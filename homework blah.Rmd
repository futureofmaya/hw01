# Homework 1, Rita Biagioli

## _Ok, not clear what I'm doing at all_
1. First what I did was generally click around on Github. I forked the response and tried to edit it from there
2. I created a pull request on the site
3. I realized I was supposed to be using R Markdown in RStudio, so I attempted to clone the original document, which first opened in LaTeX, then I figured out how to open in in RStudio and make it such that I can commit, push, and pull. First I'll pull to make sure no other changes have happened since I've worked on this.
4. As soon as I'm done writing this, I'll do exactly that and see if it works. Update: Had to click knit HTML. Not totally sure if that added anything to this process, but then I could see a preview...
5. Hopefully, then this will be submitted.
